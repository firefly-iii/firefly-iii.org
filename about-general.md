"Firefly III" is a financial manager. It can help you keep track of expenses, income, budgets and everything in between. It even supports credit cards, shared  household accounts and savings accounts! It's pretty fancy. You should use it to save and organise money.
 
Firefly works on the principle that if you know where you're money is going, you can stop it from going there.

Of course, to get to know Firefly III first, and to see if it fits you, please check out these resources:

- The [screenshots]({{ 'about-screenshots.html' | absolute_url }}) so you can see what it looks like;
- The [feature list]({{ 'about-features.html' | absolute_url }}) so you know what it does;
- The [grand theory]({{ 'about-grand-theory.html' | absolute_url }}), which will tell you how Firefly works, and the philosophy behind it;
- The [demo site](https://firefly-iii.nder.be/) so you can see what it's like.

Soon, you can also find Firefly III on the Sandstorm.io app market!
